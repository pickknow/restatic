New site, new domain, new homepage 
First, a little bit of housekeeping.

To celebrate the launch of the new docs and, more importantly, to clearly separate the old and the new content, we’ve moved to the shorter react.dev domain. The old reactjs.org domain will now redirect here.

The old React docs are now archived at legacy.reactjs.org. All existing links to the old content will automatically redirect there to avoid “breaking the web”, but the legacy site will not get many more updates.

Believe it or not, React will soon be ten years old. In JavaScript years, it’s like a whole century! We’ve refreshed the React homepage to reflect why we think React is a great way to create user interfaces today, and updated the getting started guides to more prominently mention modern React-based frameworks.

If you haven’t seen the new homepage yet, check it out!

Going all-in on modern React with Hooks 
When we released React Hooks in 2018, the Hooks docs assumed the reader is familiar with class components. This helped the community adopt Hooks very swiftly, but after a while the old docs failed to serve the new readers. New readers had to learn React twice: once with class components and then once again with Hooks.

The new docs teach React with Hooks from the beginning. The docs are divided in two main sections:

Learn React is a self-paced course that teaches React from scratch.
API Reference provides the details and usage examples for every React API.
Let’s have a closer look at what you can find in each section.
