## ReStatic: Your Markdown-Powered Static Blog Generator

ReStatic is a lightweight, Remix-powered tool that turns your Markdown or Word files into a fully functional static blog in seconds. Simply copy your existing Markdown files into the directory, or drop in a Word document, and ReStatic will generate the corresponding web pages—no database or complex setup required. With server-side rendering (SSR) and an auto-generated menu based on your content structure, it’s perfect for developers crafting a personal site or writers sharing their ideas. Plus, you can easily customize your site’s title, description, and more. Static sites, dynamic power—built for creators, by creators, with zero fuss.
