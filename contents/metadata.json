Privacy Protection & Data Security\n\nBookmark Tagger runs entirely on your local device and does not upload your bookmark data. It also has minimal impact on your browser‚Äôs performance, ensuring a safe and seamless experience.\n\n## How to Get Started?\n\n1. **Install Bookmark Tagger**\n   - Search for \"Bookmark Tagger\" on the Chrome Web Store or Edge Add-ons Store and install it.\n   \n2. **Add Tags When Saving a Bookmark**\n   - Each time you save a bookmark, a tag input box will appear, allowing you to assign multiple tags.\n\n3. **Find Bookmarks Using Tags**\n   - Use the search bar to enter tags and instantly filter related bookmarks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhether you're a developer, designer, or casual user, **Bookmark Tagger** helps you manage bookmarks more efficiently, making knowledge organization simpler than ever.
