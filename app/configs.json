Drop your content into the mix, and let ReStatic handle the rest—automatically generating pages with server-side rendering (SSR) and a dynamic menu based on your structure. Whether you're a developer crafting a personal site or a writer sharing your thoughts, ReStatic delivers a fast, simple, and modern blogging experience. Static sites, dynamic power—built for creators, by creators.\n",
  "indexBottom": "Tone: Friendly yet technical, appealing to both developers and casual users.\n\nKey Points: Highlights Remix, SSR, Markdown, static generation, and ease of use.\n\nLength: Short enough for a GitHub README or landing page intro.\n\nLet me know if you’d like it tweaked—maybe more technical, shorter, or with a different vibe!\n\n"
